The Turbulence Probe Head contains 15 probes laid out in a variety of multi-functional arrays. The array layouts were designed using a synthetic approach, where layout designs were iterated in turbulence models to optimise for maximum data collection.

## Mach Probe Array

The Mach probes are highlighted in red, and separated from the main flow of the plasma in the recessed cutouts. This array is useful in determining the flow of the plasma across the probe. The Mach number equations are given by:

$$
M_\infty \approx M_\perp = K \ln{\left(\frac{j^+_\mathrm{Sat, \, Up}}{j^+_\mathrm{Sat, \, Dwn}}\right)}
$$,

where \\(K\\) is a calibration constant, and \\(j^+_\mathrm{Sat}\\) is the upstream/downstream ion saturation current density.

## Ball-Pen Probes

The larger probes highlighted in green on the design are known as 'Ball-Pen probes', they consist of a recessed probe into the shield.
