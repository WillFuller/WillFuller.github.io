I am currently finishing off my PhD with the University of Warwick but I'm based at UKAEA's Culham campus working on the MAST-U spherical tokamak. At UKAEA I am currently the assistant Responsible Officer (RO) for the midplane reciprocating probe, which means I get to get hands-on with a tempermental pnumatic driven reciprocation system with changeble heads! This makes operation more complex and chaotic, especially when a new probe head is swapped out. I do my best to understand the system and organise the rat's nest of cables as best I can though!

### Source
------
This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers *the creator's* personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).
