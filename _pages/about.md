I am currently finishing off my PhD with the University of Warwick but I'm based at UKAEA's Culham campus working on the MAST-U spherical tokamak. At UKAEA I am the assistant Responsible Officer (RO) for the midplane reciprocating probe (RP), which means I get to get hands-on with a tempermental pnumatic driven reciprocation system with changeble heads! This makes operation more complex and chaotic, especially when a new probe head is swapped out. I do my best to understand the system and organise the rat's nest of cables as best I can though!

My PhD project is centered around designing a new probe head for the RP system on MAST-U, targeting turbulent measurements in the scrape-off layer (SOL). I designed a probe head named the "Turbulence Probe Head". It has 15 different Langmuir Probes arranged in several multi-functional arrays to capture as much information from the plasma as possible.

I am a former cryogenic test engineer, where I wired, tested, and installed custom cryogenic systems across the globe. These systems were used mostly for materials research and quantum computing. I worked mostly on dry cryostats, where a small amount of Helium gas was liquified and cooled copper stages via conduction in a closed loop. But I also occasionally worked on wet cryostats which use large amounts of liquid Helium, such as dilution fridges, capable of < 5mK temperatures!

This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers *the creator's* personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).
