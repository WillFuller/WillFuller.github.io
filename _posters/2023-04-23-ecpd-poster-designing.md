### Poster Description

This poster describes some of the synthetic work I undertook to aid in the design of an array of Langmuir Probes targeting turbulence measurements in the SOL in the MAST-U [tokamak](https://ccfe.ukaea.uk/programmes/mast-upgrade/).

*[SOL]: Scrape-off Layer
*[MAST-U]: Mega Ampere Spherical Tokamak - Upgrade
