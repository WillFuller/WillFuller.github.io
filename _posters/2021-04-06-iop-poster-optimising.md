### Poster Description

This poster describes some of the synthetic using a stochastic model for filament dynamics I undertook to aid in the design of an array of Langmuir Probes targeting filament velocity distribution measurements in the SOL. [Interactive poster](https://plasma2021-iop.ipostersessions.com/Default.aspx?s=F9-04-28-C9-07-D3-6B-02-1A-7A-3F-E5-7C-88-12-7D).
